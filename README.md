### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm juseice, just a student now. Currently learning UE4 but still unable to program something on my own.
I was working on translating TESV's mods into Chinese. But after Skyrim Citizen closed, I stop working on it.
Paradox games fans! Also want to mod some games like Stellaris and Crusader Kings. 
Who knows what will happen in the future.
